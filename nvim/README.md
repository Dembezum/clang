### Why this?
My goal of this setup is to make it as simple as possible, not only to setup,
but also to use.


* Simple but effecient [LSP](https://neovim.io/doc/user/lsp.html)

* Well documented [maps](https://neovim.io/doc/user/map.html)

* [Plugins](https://neovim.io/doc/user/vim_diff.html#nvim-features) to give a
    great experience

* Effecient workflow

If you are a developer or a power user looking for a fast and extensible
editor, Neovim is definitely worth trying. Its modern architecture and APIs
make it more maintainable and extensible than Vim, while preserving the same
editing experience and compatibility with Vim plugins. Neovim also offers
features like built-in terminal emulation, job control, and Lua-based plugins
development, which make it a great tool for modern and optimized workflows.

To put things in perspective, there's millions of different neovim configs. Some
of these are super fast to setup, others are rather complex looking.


### Install
So ***the time has come***, you want to install this for yourself. Great thing
i was prepared for that!

### Modular
As you can see, this way of setting up neovim, makes it super simply to
reconfigure, restructure, and extend.

### Screenshots

It's a grat hobby of mine. To make stuff look great, so without a drop of
hesitation, the first thing that came to mind when making this, was to rice the
**** out of it!
